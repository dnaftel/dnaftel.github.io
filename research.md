"[Elusive consensus: Polarization in elite communication on the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abc2717)," *Science Advances*, 2020, 6(28), with Jon Green, Jared Edgerton, Kelsey Shoub, and Skyler Cranmer

Abstract: *Cues sent by political elites are known to influence public attitudes and behavior. Polarization in elite rhetoric may hinder effective responses to public health crises, when accurate information and rapid behavioral change can save lives. We examine polarization in cues sent to the public by current members of the U.S. House and Senate during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring polarization as the ability to correctly classify the partisanship of tweets’ authors based solely on the text and the dates they were sent. We find that Democrats discussed the crisis more frequently–emphasizing threats to public health and American workers–while Republicans placed greater emphasis on China and businesses. Polarization in elite discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in mid-February—weeks after the first confirmed case in the United States—and continued into March. These divergent cues correspond with a partisan divide in the public’s early reaction to the crisis*

## Working Papers

"When Policing Mobilizes: Political Action in the Wake of Anti-Gang Crackdowns" (Job market paper)

Abstract: *The presence and practices of the police vary substantially across place. Frequent and aggressive enforcement is often highly concentrated in specific neighborhoods, where officers are directed to preempt crime with tactics that generate large numbers of stops and arrests. How do these aggressive policies affect political behavior in the places they target? I exploit a policy that led to substantial within-neighborhood variation in the power and practices of the police, and show that residents reacted strongly to these changes. Beginning in the 1990s, a series of court-ordered injunctions against Los Angeles gangs established areas of the city where police powers were expanded, aggressive enforcement was encouraged, and the civil liberties of suspected gang members were severely curtailed. Drawing on a wide array of data sources, including aggregate and individual-level registration and turnout data, revealed preferences from ballot initiatives, and a panel survey, I find these harsh anti-gang crackdowns led to large increases in both electoral and non-electoral participation, particularly among Black, Latino, and young individuals. I find corresponding increases in support for criminal justice reform and self-reported discriminatory encounters with the police, consistent with claims that gang injunctions led to widespread racial profiling. Together, these findings suggest that concentrated anti-crime measures can have substantial electoral
effects that extend far beyond those who are directly stopped and questioned by the police.*


"[Meet the Press: Gendered Conversational Norms in Televised Political Discussion](https://osf.io/my8us)," with Jon Green, Kelsey Shoub, Jared Edgerton, Mallory Wagner, and Skyler Cranmer (Revise and Resubmit, *Journal of Politics*)

Abstract: *Political television shows are among the most highly visible forms of informal political discussion in the United States. Given their potential to shape the political perceptions and discussions of ordinary citizens, it is important that women can equally participate in such settings. We extend prior work connecting gender composition, decision rules, and gender inequality in formal settings by examining the structural features of gender inequality in over 6,000 panel discussions that aired on political shows in the U.S. between 2000 and 2017. We find that on "debate-style" panels that encourage majoritarian conversational norms, women speak more and are interrupted less as they account for an increasing share of panelists. These relationships are weakened in panels with more consensus-oriented norms. Our findings highlight how the structural features of televised political discussions may contribute to gender inequalities in the broader political system, setting problematic behavioral norms for the public to emulate.*
