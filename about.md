I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Ohio State University. I study the incentives, institutions, and norms that produce unequal and discriminatory policy outcomes in the United States, and examine how these forces influence political behavior. My current work investigates (1) the causal effect of aggressive police tactics on political attitudes and voting in poor communities of color, (2) how cable news contributes to disparities in political voice, and (3) electoral distortions in the provision of public goods. I rely on a wide range of data sources and empirical strategies including both natural and survey experiments, machine learning, natural language processing, qualitative interviews, panel surveys, and administrative data obtained through public records requests. My work has been published in *Science Advances*, with a second paper under invitation to revise and resubmit at *Journal of Politics*.

Before joining Ohio State, I earned my B.A. in International Affairs from the University of Colorado, Boulder. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Ohio State Universityâ€™s Distinguished University Fellowship, and the Mershon Center Graduate Research Grant.
