I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Ohio State University. My work investigates the political effects of the criminal justice system, as well as the causes and consequences of inequalities in political voice and the provision of public services. My dissertation, *Identifying the Effects of Policing on Voter Behavior*, leverages anti-crime crackdowns and a series of randomized policing experiences to measure the impact of aggressive police tactics on political attitudes and voting behavior.

Before joining Ohio State, I earned my B.A. in International Affairs from the University of Colorado, Boulder. My work has been supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and various grants including the Mershon Center Research Grant.
