I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Ohio State University. I study racial and gender inequality in the American political system, with a particular focus on voting, public policy, the criminal justice system, and news media. I aim to understand the incentives, institutions, and norms that produce unequal and discriminatory policy outcomes, and to examine how these forces influence political behavior. My current work explores the effect of police tactics on political attitudes and voting, how cable news contributes to disparities in political voice, and electoral distortions in the provision of public goods. To do so I rely on a wide range of data sources and empirical strategies including both natural and survey experiments, machine learning, natural language processing, qualitative interviews, panel surveys, and administrative data obtained through public records requests. My work has been published in *Science Advances*, with a second paper under invitation to revise and resubmit at *Journal of Politics*.

Before joining Ohio State, I earned my B.A. in International Affairs from the University of Colorado, Boulder. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Ohio State Universityâ€™s Distinguished University Fellowship, and the Mershon Center Graduate Research Grant.
